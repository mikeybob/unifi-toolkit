## Features

### Dashboard
Real-time system status including:
- **Gateway Info** - Model, firmware, uptime
- **Resource Usage** - CPU and RAM utilization
- **Network Health** - WAN, LAN, WLAN, VPN status with diagnostic reasons
- **Connected Clients** - Wired and wireless counts
- **WAN Status** - IP, ISP, latency, uptime (supports 3+ WANs dynamically)
- **Debug Info** - One-click copy of system info for issue reporting

### Wi-Fi Stalker
Track specific client devices through your UniFi infrastructure.
- Device tracking by MAC address (wireless and wired)
- Roaming detection between access points
- Connection history with timestamps and CSV export
- Signal strength, radio band (2.4/5/6 GHz), and SSID tracking
- Device analytics: dwell time, favorite AP, presence pattern heatmap
- Block/unblock devices directly from the UI
- Webhook alerts (Slack, Discord, n8n) for connect, disconnect, roam, block, and unblock events

### Threat Watch
Monitor IDS/IPS security events from your UniFi gateway.
- Real-time event monitoring (requires UniFi OS)
- Threat categorization and analysis
- Top attackers and targets
- Ignore rules: filter noise by IP address and severity level
- Sortable event columns and advanced filtering
- Webhook alerts (Slack, Discord, n8n)

### House Arrest
Lock a device or a whole network down using UniFi's zone-based firewall. Reversible in one click, and honest about exactly what is and is not being blocked.
- **Networks** - Editable audit matrix of your VLANs: firewall zone, network isolation, internet access, mDNS, and DHCP DNS at a glance, with per-SSID Wi-Fi client isolation
- **DNS Lockdown** - Force chosen networks onto approved DNS resolvers and block everything else answering DNS (optionally DNS-over-TLS too)
- **Devices** - Per-device lockdown presets by MAC: Full lockdown, Internet only, or LAN only, with multi-device selection
- **Blocked traffic view** - See what each lockdown actually stopped, attributed to its own rules by ID
- Every change is previewed before applying, every rule carries a marker so release can only ever delete its own rules, and a lockdown that stops enforcing (MAC changed, rule disabled in UniFi) is flagged instead of shown green
- **Requires the zone-based firewall** (UniFi Network 9.0+ on a UniFi OS console)

See [docs/HOUSE-ARREST.md](docs/HOUSE-ARREST.md) for the full guide, including measured limitations.

### Network Pulse
Real-time network monitoring dashboard.
- Gateway status (model, firmware, uptime, WAN)
- Device counts (total clients, wired, wireless, APs, switches)
- Chart.js visualizations (clients by band, clients by SSID, top bandwidth)
- Clickable AP cards with detailed client views
- WebSocket-powered live updates

## Common Commands

| Start (local) | `docker compose up -d` |
| Start (production) | `docker compose --profile production up -d` |
| Stop | `docker compose down` |
| View logs | `docker compose logs -f` |

Images are published to both GHCR (`ghcr.io/crosstalk-solutions/unifi-toolkit`) and Docker Hub (`crosstalksolutions/unifi-toolkit`), and they are identical. `:latest` is the release channel and only moves on tagged releases. `:edge` is the beta channel, rebuilt on every merge. See [Running the beta channel](docs/INSTALLATION.md#running-the-beta-edge-channel).

---

## Configuration

### Setup Wizard (Recommended)

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The wizard will:
- Generate encryption key
- Configure deployment mode (local/production)
- Set up authentication (production only)
- Create your `.env` file

### Manual Configuration

Copy and edit the example configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Required Settings

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypts stored credentials (auto-generated by setup wizard) |

#### Deployment Settings (Production Only)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` | `local` or `production` |
| `DOMAIN` | Your domain name (e.g., `toolkit.example.com`) |
| `AUTH_USERNAME` | Admin username |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` | Bcrypt password hash (generated by setup wizard) |

#### UniFi Controller Settings

UniFi controller credentials are configured **through the web UI** after first
launch (the gear icon on the dashboard). They are stored encrypted in the
database, not read from environment variables.

| Setting (web UI) | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Controller URL | Local controller IP/hostname (e.g., `https://192.168.1.1`) |
| API key | Recommended. Generate in UniFi OS Settings → Admins |
| Username / password | Fallback if not using an API key |
| Site ID | Site ID from URL, not friendly name (default: `default`). For multi-site, use ID from `/manage/site/{id}/...` |
| Verify SSL | Off by default (self-signed controller certificates) |

> **Note:** Use your controller's local IP address (e.g., `https://192.168.1.1`). Cloud access via `unifi.ui.com` is not supported.

#### Other Settings

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `STALKER_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | Device refresh interval in seconds (default: `60`) |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Extra hostnames allowed to reach the toolkit (comma separated). The toolkit rejects requests whose Host header is not an IP, `localhost`, a `.local`-style name, or your `DOMAIN`, which protects against DNS-rebinding. If you access it through a Tailscale name or reverse-proxy alias, add that name here. |

Every secret-carrying variable also accepts a `_FILE` variant (e.g. `ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/key`) for Docker Swarm / Kubernetes secrets mounted as files.

## Security

### Authentication

- **Local mode**: No authentication (trusted LAN only)
- **Production mode**: Session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Rate limiting**: 5 failed login attempts = 5 minute lockout

### HTTPS

Production deployments use Caddy for automatic HTTPS:
- Let's Encrypt certificates (auto-renewed)
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### Multi-Site Networking

When managing multiple UniFi sites, always use site-to-site VPN:

```
✅ RECOMMENDED: VPN Connection
┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
│  UI Toolkit      │◄──VPN──►│  Remote UniFi    │
│  Server          │         │  Controller      │
└──────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘

❌ AVOID: Direct Internet Exposure
Never expose UniFi controllers via port forwarding
```

**VPN Options:** UniFi Site-to-Site, WireGuard, Tailscale, IPSec

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to UniFi controller
- **UniFi OS required.** Standalone/self-hosted controllers are not supported (v1.11.0+). If you're running the Java-based controller software, v1.10.3 is the last compatible version.
- **Stable (GA) firmware only.** Early Access firmware changes APIs without notice and is not supported. If a tool suddenly gets errors or empty data, check your firmware channel first (your firmware version is in Debug Info).
- Set `UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL=false` for self-signed certificates
- API key auth is recommended. Generate in UniFi OS Settings → Admins
- Verify network connectivity to controller

### Device not showing as online
- Wait 60 seconds for the next refresh cycle
- Verify MAC address format is correct
- Confirm device is connected in UniFi dashboard

### Let's Encrypt certificate fails
- Verify DNS A record points to your server
- Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open
- Check Caddy logs: `docker compose logs caddy`

### Rate limited on login
- Wait 5 minutes for lockout to expire
- Use `./reset_password.sh` if you forgot your password

### Requests rejected when using a hostname
- The toolkit only answers requests addressed to an IP, `localhost`, a `.local`-style name, or your configured `DOMAIN` (anti-DNS-rebinding protection). Add other names, like a Tailscale MagicDNS name or a reverse-proxy alias, to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `.env`.

### Docker issues
- Verify `.env` exists and contains `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- Pull latest image: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`

## Running with Python (Alternative to Docker)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/unifi-toolkit.git
cd unifi-toolkit

# Create virtual environment (Python 3.9+)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run setup wizard
./setup.sh

# Start application
python run.py
```

To keep it running across reboots, copy `unifi-toolkit.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/`, edit the user and paths, then `sudo systemctl enable --now unifi-toolkit`. See [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md#run-as-a-systemd-service).
